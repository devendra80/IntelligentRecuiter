AI project to shortlist resumes
This project is created with the help below project https://github.com/divapriya/Language_Processing.

I am creating a program to short list resume based on candidate relevence as follows.

1. Show no of resumes and name of skills matched.
2. Relevent resume under same skills. Relevence is scored based on number of projects candidate worked on a given skills.


To Run this application.

2. Put your resumes in <Project_Home>/resumes/
3. Edit IntelligentRecruiter.py file as resume_repo = '<Project_Home>/resumes/'
4. Create myncr-testing-skills.txt file in <Project_Home> folder and enter skill row-wise (1 in each row). 
5. Run IntelligentRecruiter.py  as python program
6. Once run successfully. run server.py
7. http://127.0.0.1:5000 is the url to go
